> This is a Microverse Ruby on Rails Capstone Project

> Groupify!

## Description

Groupify is a web app that allows users with a particular mindset to share articles or any content that pertains to the group. Users get to create groups, then create articles under that group name and image. Users of the app can see all articles in the feeds section, while having the opportunity to view individuals' articles in their profile. Users can like articles and provide feedback and information. 

The apps function is so stellar that you can see who has liked and commented on an article. It shows group names as #hashtags and provides a default #groupify for stray articles.

There are sections for example in the recent section, users can see articles in the latest written articles. The viceversa is true since users can see articles in ancient order.
